'''
Performing QR at each step is computationally expensive. We observe at each iteration if the matrix Ai is a tridiagonal matrix then Ai+1 would also be a tridiagonal matrix and the QR factorization of a tridiagonal matrix can be computed using Givens Rotations.

In this problem you will compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix A, for which you would first use Householder transformations to reduce the matrix A to a tridiagonal matrix T. Then you will run QR iteration with a shift on T. The shift at every iteration is equal to the (n,n)-th entry of the matrix Ai. Stop your iterative process when the maximum change in the eigenvalues between iterations falls below 10âˆ’10.

For your assistance the setup code also includes a function for computing the householder vector called Householder(A, col, row_start, row_end). You may readily invoke this function in your solution.
